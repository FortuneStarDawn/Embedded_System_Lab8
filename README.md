Basic 1:

Use the analog joystick to control the RGB LED through PWM.

Turn the analog joystick and change the light intensity of red and blue LEDs as follows:

When the analog stick moves down, red LED will be the brightest. Turn off red LED, when the analog stick is up.

When the analog stick moves left, blue LED will be the brightest and turn off the blue LED, when analog stick is right. 

While the analog joystick is pressed, send 0V to green pin. Otherwise, send 3V to green pin.

Basic 2:

Glue an arrow shaped paper on a stick and put them on the axis of the stepper motor.

Move the arrow corresponding to the input from the analog joystick.

If you can only control four directions, you will get 70 percent of the score.
